// Answers:

// The JavaScript function used to get the current date and time is new Date().
// The JavaScript object that represents a date and time is Date.
// To get the current year, you can use the getFullYear() method on the Date object.
// To get the current month, you can use the getMonth() method on the Date object.
// To get the current day of the month, you can use the getDate() method on the Date object.
// To get the current hour, you can use the getHours() method on the Date object.
// To get the current minute, you can use the getMinutes() method on the Date object.
// To get the current second, you can use the getSeconds() method on the Date object.
// To format the current date and time in a specific format, you can use the toLocaleDateString() and toLocaleTimeString() methods on the Date object.
// To get the difference between two dates and times, you can use the getTime() method on the Date object. The getTime() method returns the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch. You can then subtract the getTime() values of the two dates to get the difference in milliseconds.
